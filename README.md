# Coffee Workflow Digitization System

## Project Overview

The Coffee Workflow Digitization System aims to streamline the buying, selling, and processing workflow for coffee vendors in Ethiopia. This system will digitize the entire process, making it efficient, transparent, and resistant to fraud. It comprises interconnected systems designed to handle different aspects of the coffee business.

### Main Systems

1. **Admin System**: Provides comprehensive reports and monitoring capabilities for company owners and top-level management.
2. **Container Management System**: Records coffee quantities and quality as it enters and leaves processing containers.
3. **Marketing System**: Handles transactions, pricing, and receipts for marketers buying coffee from farmers and selling it.
4. **Worker Management System**: Manages and tracks worker activities, attendance, and performance.

### Technology Stack

- **Mobile Application (Android)**:
    
    - Programming Language: java
    - Development Framework: Android SDK
    - Database: SQLite (for offline storage)
    - Sync Mechanism: WorkManager for background synchronization tasks
- **Desktop Application**:
    
    - Programming Language: Java with JavaFX or C# with WPF
    - Database: SQLite (for local storage)
    - Sync Mechanism: Scheduled tasks or services for background synchronization
- **Backend Server**:
    
    - Programming Language: Python with Django or Flask, or Node.js
    - Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
    - API: RESTful APIs for communication between mobile/desktop apps and the server
    - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
    - Data Sync: Periodic synchronization using REST APIs

### Development Plan

1. **Requirement Analysis and Design (1 week)**
2. **Development (5 weeks)**
3. **Testing and Deployment (1.5 weeks)**

### Prioritized Features for MVP

1. **Admin System**:
    
    - Dashboard with key metrics.
    - Basic report generation.
    - User management.
2. **Container Management System**:
    
    - Record coffee entry and exit.
    - Track basic processing stages.
    - Generate and print simple receipts.
3. **Marketing System**:
    
    - Record transactions.
    - Track daily prices.
    - Manage payments and loans.
4. **Worker Management System**:
    
    - Track attendance.
    - Assign tasks and monitor completion.

### Additional Features and Considerations
